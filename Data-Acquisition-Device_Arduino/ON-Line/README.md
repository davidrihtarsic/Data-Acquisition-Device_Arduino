# ON-line DAQ
Since Arduino is rather a small device we have limited options to show data. In that aspect is very useful to connect Arduino to a computer and present the data there. That is why we need "on-line" connection of Arduino-DAQ.

We have several options to communicate with Arduino-DAQ and present the data:
* simply present the "raw data numbers" using serial communication,
* present the data in graphical form (using Arduino IDE, ...)
* writing our own program in Python using Python API functions for communication with Arduino or
* use Microsoft Excel prepared files with macros for sampling and presenting the data.
